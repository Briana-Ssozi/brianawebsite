 I am an undergraduate student at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, studying Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity. Despite my lack of experience in the field, I am eager to learn and grow.
 I am passionate about technology and eager to pursue new opportunities, whether in the fashion or legal industries.
 I am open to everything if it means I can learn more.
 I am looking for internships or entry-level positions to gain practical experience and enhance my skills.
